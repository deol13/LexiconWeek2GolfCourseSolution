# LexiconWeek2GolfCourseSolution

This is a remade version of LexiconGolfOptionAssignmentSolution because I had problems using test unit on it because of how it was set up.
I need add a new class with all the methods that used to be in main.
I made a new project because I wanted the old one incase I did something wrong with this new version

Unit testing done with Unit Test Project for .NET Core in Visual Studio
All other unit testing from here on will be done with xUnit
